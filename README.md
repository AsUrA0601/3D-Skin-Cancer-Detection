# 3D-Skin-Cancer-Detection
Hybrid skin cancer detection using 2D ensemble (EfficientNetV2 + ResNet50) and synthetic 3D CNN analysis. Converts single 2D dermoscopic images into 3D volumes via monodepth augmentation. Trained on ISIC 2024 dataset for dual-path prediction: planar and volumetric insights.
